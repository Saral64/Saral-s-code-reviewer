# Saral's Code Reviewer

**Saral's Code Reviewer** is an AI-powered tool that helps developers improve their code quality by providing detailed and actionable reviews. Built with **Google Cloud’s Gemini-1.5-Flash** model and **Streamlit**, this tool automates the code review process, covering various aspects such as bug detection, code optimization, security, and more.

The tool generates insightful reviews that help developers catch bugs faster, optimize code performance, improve security, and maintain coding standards—all through an intuitive web interface.

## Features

- **Overall Quality Summary**: Provides a high-level overview of the code, focusing on functionality, structure, and readability.
- **Bug Identification & Error Handling**: Detects potential bugs, runtime errors, and edge cases.
- **Code Optimization Suggestions**: Suggests improvements to optimize performance, memory usage, and speed.
- **Code Clarity & Structure**: Analyzes the readability and organization of the code, suggesting improvements in naming conventions and modularization.
- **Security Considerations**: Identifies potential security risks and recommends improvements for safe code practices.
- **Documentation & Comments**: Suggests ways to improve inline comments and documentation for better maintainability.
- **Testing & Coverage**: Assesses the coverage of unit tests and suggests improvements for testing critical cases.
- **Style Consistency**: Ensures adherence to standard coding styles and conventions (e.g., PEP 8, JavaScript Standard).
- **Compliance with Coding Standards**: Verifies that the code complies with industry standards and best practices.
- **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**: Analyzes the efficiency of the code using Big O notation and suggests optimizations.
- **Refactoring Opportunities**: Identifies areas of code that could benefit from refactoring for better readability and maintainability.
- **Final Recommendations**: Provides a summary of the review and actionable steps to improve the code quality.

## Technologies Used

- **Google Cloud’s Gemini-1.5-Flash Model**: Powers the AI-based code review functionality.
- **Streamlit**: Used for building the user interface, making it easy for users to interact with the tool.
- **Python**: The backend is built using Python, leveraging the `google.generativeai` library for integration with the Gemini model.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/saral-s-code-reviewer.git
   ```
2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

4. **Input your code**: Enter your code into the input field on the web interface and click **Generate the review**. The tool will generate a detailed review for your code.

## Example

Here's an example of the type of review Saral's Code Reviewer can generate:

```vbnet
Overall Quality Summary: The code is well-organized and achieves its intended functionality...
Bug Identification & Error Handling: The function `calculate()` may raise a division by zero error when the denominator is zero...
Code Optimization Suggestions: Consider using a dictionary instead of a list for faster lookups...
...
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Support for more programming languages**: Currently supports Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++.
- **Advanced Debugging**: Add more advanced debugging suggestions based on real-world code patterns.
- **Customizable Review Output**: Provide options for users to customize the depth and focus of the code review.
- **Integration with Version Control Systems**: Allow for code review directly from GitHub or GitLab repositories.
